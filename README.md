![Final Product](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd64a960-2d0b-4193-bc5f-cbd043b44ac4)

> [!NOTE]
> Why carry boring paper cards when you can *print on demand* and watch people's faces light up?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Optimized for Star TSP100III(U) using 80mm paper on 72mm print width. Other printers may need tweaking!

## ‚ú® What's this?
A dead-simple web app that turns your thermal receipt printer into a business card factory! Stand out at your next event with cards that are actually *interesting*!

## üî• Coolest Features
- **One-click printing** from any browser
- **Photo optimization** that actually works on thermal paper
- **QR codes** that don't look like garbage
- **Live preview** so you don't waste paper
- **Zero installation** - just open the HTML file

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Open index.html
2. Upload your face
3. Type your details
4. Hit print
5. Watch jaws drop

> [!TIP]
> I print via USB from Windows using STAR's utility ([download here](https://starmicronics.com/support/download/starprnt-intelligence-software-full-v3-7-2/)), but network/CUPS works too!

> [!TIP]
> I find having an image already in black and white yields the best results for image printing. I use an already B&W image of myself that works great. For THE BEST RESULTS, use an image of you with a white or transparent background.

## üí∏ Why This Rules
- **SO CHEAP** - thermal paper costs pennies
- **MEMORABLE** - who else has receipt cards?
- **ON-DEMAND** - print only what you need
- **HACKABLE** - tweak the CSS to your heart's content
